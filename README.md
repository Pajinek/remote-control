Web browser on a computer connected through a wired LAN system lets you remotely operate projectors and check their status. An e-mail messaging function can also notify you when a lamp needs replacement, and indicate the overall projector status.

In addition, Multi Projector Monitoring and Control Software is available for monitoring and controlling multiple Panasonic projectors from a single PC.

The wired LAN terminal is compatible with PJLinkâ„¢ (class1), an open protocol that is used by many manufacturers, to enable integrated control of systems that contain different brands of projectors.
